## What is pfp.blue?

pfp.blue is a simple yet powerful tool that automatically visualizes progress indicators from your Bluesky display name as a circular overlay on your profile picture. 

Whether you're tracking your progress through a book, a project, or any other goal, pfp.blue makes it visible directly in your profile picture across the Bluesky network.

## Features

- **Progress Visualization:** Automatically updates your profile picture with a circular progress indicator based on fractions (like "3/10") or percentages (like "30%") in your display name
- **Original Picture Preservation:** Keeps your original profile picture safe and uses it as the base for the progress visualization
- **Multiple Account Support:** Link and manage multiple Bluesky accounts in one place
- **Simple Toggle:** Enable or disable the progress visualization feature with a single click
- **Secure Authentication:** Uses Bluesky's OAuth for secure account access

## How It Works

1. **Sign in** with your Bluesky account
2. **Set a progress indicator** in your Bluesky display name (like "3/10" or "30%")
3. **Enable the feature** on your pfp.blue profile
4. **Watch your progress** appear as a visual indicator on your profile picture

pfp.blue automatically detects when you update your display name and refreshes your profile picture to reflect your current progress.
